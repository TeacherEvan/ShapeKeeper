## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Web Server (Recommended)

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (with http-server)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

> `game.js` and `welcome.js` are loaded as browser ES modules, so opening
> `index.html` directly with `file://` is no longer a supported startup path.

### Option 2: Live Deployment

Visit [https://shape-keeper.vercel.app](https://shape-keeper.vercel.app).

## 📐 Grid Sizes

The game offers four preset grid sizes that automatically adapt to your display:

| Selection | Square Mode | Landscape Mode\* | Total Squares |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 5×5       | 5×5 grid    | ~7×4 grid        | 16 squares    |
| 10×10     | 10×10 grid  | ~16×7 grid       | 81 squares    |
| 20×20     | 20×20 grid  | ~33×14 grid      | 361 squares   |
| 30×30     | 30×30 grid  | ~50×18 grid      | 841 squares   |

\*Landscape mode activates when aspect ratio > 1.5

## 🎯 How to Play

### Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Complete more squares than your opponent
2. **Turns**: Players alternate drawing lines between adjacent dots
3. **Scoring**: Complete a square by drawing its fourth side to earn a point
4. **Bonus Turn**: Complete a square to earn another turn immediately
5. **Multipliers**: Tap completed squares to reveal score multipliers
6. **Winning**: Player with the most points when the grid is full wins

### Controls

- **Mouse**: Click dots to select and connect them
- **Touch**: Tap dots on touchscreen devices
- **Selection**: Click a dot, then click an adjacent dot to draw a line
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected dot shows a colored ring
- **Multipliers**: Click/tap completed squares to reveal and apply multipliers

### Strategy Tips

- Plan ahead to avoid giving opponents easy squares
- Try to complete multiple squares in one turn
- Control the endgame by managing available moves
- Watch for "double-cross" patterns

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Components

`index.html` is the browser entrypoint. `convex-client.js` is loaded as a
classic script so it can expose `window.ShapeKeeperConvex`, while `game.js`
and `welcome.js` are loaded as ES modules and serve as the authoritative
runtime entry scripts for the competition branch.

#### DotsAndBoxesGame Class (`dots-and-boxes-game.js`)

- **State Management**: Lines (Set), Squares (Object), Triangles (Object), Scores (Object)
- **Rendering Engine**: HTML5 Canvas with 60fps animation loop
- **Event Handling**: Mouse, touch, and resize events
- **Game Logic**: Square and triangle detection, turn management, win conditions

#### Key Methods

```javascript
setupCanvas(); // Adaptive layout calculation
getNearestDot(); // Collision detection for dot selection
checkForSquares(); // Square completion detection
checkForTriangles(); // Triangle completion detection (diagonal lines)
draw(); // Main rendering loop
animate(); // Animation frame management
```

### Data Structures

#### Line Keys (Normalized)

```javascript
'1,2-1,3'; // Horizontal line from (1,2) to (1,3)
'1,2-2,2'; // Vertical line from (1,2) to (2,2)
'1,1-2,2'; // Diagonal line from (1,1) to (2,2)
```

Always sorted to prevent duplicates.

#### Square Keys

```javascript
'5,10'; // Square at row 5, column 10
```

#### Triangle Keys

```javascript
'tri-1,2-TR'; // Triangle at top-right of cell (1,2)
```

### Coordinate System

```javascript
screenX = offsetX + col × cellSize
screenY = offsetY + row × cellSize
```

- Origin: Top-left corner
- Grid: 0-indexed rows and columns

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Grid Sizes

Edit `index.html` to add new grid size buttons:

```html
<button class="grid-btn" data-size="40">40×40</button>
```

### Adjusting Visual Properties

In `game.js` constructor:

```javascript
this.dotRadius = 1.6; // Dot size
this.lineWidth = 2; // Line thickness
this.cellSize = 8 - 40; // Cell size range (calculated)
```

### Color Schemes

Default colors can be changed in `index.html`:

```html
<input type="color" id="player1Color" value="#FF0000" />
<input type="color" id="player2Color" value="#0000FF" />
```

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Version | Status          |
| ------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Chrome  | 90+     | ✅ Full Support |
| Firefox | 88+     | ✅ Full Support |
| Safari  | 14+     | ✅ Full Support |
| Edge    | 90+     | ✅ Full Support |
| Opera   | 76+     | ✅ Full Support |

**Requirements:**

- ES6+ JavaScript support
- HTML5 Canvas API
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

- Opening `index.html` directly via `file://` is not supported because the app
  boots with browser ES modules
- Parsing error in VSCode is cosmetic (ESLint configuration)
- Portrait mode shows rotation prompt (landscape recommended)
- Very large grids (50×50+) may impact performance on older devices
- Triangles not yet synced in multiplayer mode (local only)
